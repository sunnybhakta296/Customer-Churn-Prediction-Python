## Command to Run Index File and Save Model

To run your index file and save the trained model, use the following command in your project directory:

```bash
python index.py
```

This will execute the code in `index.py`, which should include the logic to train and save your model.

## Saving the Model

Add the following code snippet to your training script to save the trained model:

```python
import joblib

# Assuming 'model' is your trained model object
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
```

This creates a file named `model.pkl` in your project directory. You can later load this model in your API for predictions.

## How to Run the API

To start the prediction API locally, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Example `curl` Commands to Test the Prediction API

Below are sample `curl` commands to test the `/predict` endpoint. Each command sends a JSON payload with a `features` array.

```bash
# Example 1
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"features\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}"

# Example 2
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"features\": [0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,29.85,29.85]}"
